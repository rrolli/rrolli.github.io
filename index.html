			<h1>About Me</h1>

			<div>
				<p>
					I am a Electrical Engineering student at the University of Washington. 
					While my focus is embedded systems, I have greatly enjoyed my classes in software engineering.

			<h2>Hobbies</h2>

			<div>
				<p>
					When I am not busy with homework and projects, I like to do digital art. Typically,
					I start a couple of new pieces a week, and spend around 3 to 5 hours making each one. 
					You can view my work <a href="http://www.wysp.ws/3beccaboo/">here</a>.
					<br>
					<br>
					I am also learning Japanese. I am taking 2nd year classes at UW as well as learning to read kanji on the side.
					As of now, I am familiar with over 1100 kanji, and I hope to have memorized the 2200 common kanji in a few monthes.
