    <h2>Hobbies</h2>
    <p>
      When I am not busy with homework and projects, I like to do digital art. This is something I have done for many years,
      and I don't plan on stopping yet. Typically, I start a couple of new pieces a week, and spend around 2 or 3 hours making each one.
      <br>
      I also learning Japanese. I am taking 2nd year classes at UW as well as learning to read kanji on the side.
      As of now, I am familiar with over 1100 kanji, and I hope to have memorized the 2200 common kanji in a few monthes.
