        <h2>Simple RISC Microprocessor</h2>
        <p>
        For my Computer Architecture class, I developed a Verilog implementation of a simple RISC microprocessor
        based on the ARM instruction set. The microprocessor can understand and complete just a dozen ARM instruction types. 
        In this project, I created a register file and ALU unit for the microprocessor using Verilog code. 
        Once I got this part working, I modified my code to recieve instructions in using a 5-stage pipeline. 
        I also implemented some forwarding to improve the performance of the microprocessor.

        <h2>DDR Game using an FPGA</h2>
        <p>
        In Summer 2017, I developed a simple card matching game using Java. I made this game after my sister asked me
        to make a game where you pair couples together. In the game, the user flips 2 cards over at a 
        time and tries to find matches. However, there is always an odd number of cards, so one card is 
        called the "old maid". If the user clicks on this card 3 times, they lose and the game ends. The program stores high 
        scores and allows the scores to be sorted by best time or best score. Later, I added an option for the user to
        change the card images or add their own.
